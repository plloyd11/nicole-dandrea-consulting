                            Hi! My name is Nicole D’Andrea and I'm a business coach for yoga studio
                            owners and wellness practitioners. My main goal? To help women of the
                            wellness community stop undervaluing themselves and their businesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I help women think bigger, work smarter and create improved commercial
                            success so they can enjoy the financial freedom to live out their life
                            dreams, whatever their dreams may be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My consulting business was built on the success of my own studio’s
                            impressive growth trajectory. I leverage my strategic sixth sense, first
                            hand understanding and experience, and my bigger vision for the industry
                            and use this to help others build profitable businesses and achieve the
                            mindset mastery required to sustain them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have achieved tremendous results from my own studio experience and am
                            helping a growing number of clients do the same. The consulting business
                            is my means for sharing these insights and empowering others to grow
                            their mindsets and their bottom lines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm quickly gaining a reputation for being the
